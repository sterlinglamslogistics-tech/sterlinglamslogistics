/**
 * Static-export root layout for the driver-mobile-2 APK.
 *
 * This is the canonical root layout — it must provide <html> and <body>
 * because Next.js's App Router requires them at the root. build.ps1
 * SKIPS copying the main project's app/(app)/driver/layout.tsx over this
 * file (see the SkipNames list in step 2) so the wrap-in-DriverShell
 * behaviour is preserved without losing the html/body scaffolding.
 *
 * No DriverSWRegister and no PWA manifest — both are part of the live
 * web shipping model. The APK ships its UI locally so there's nothing
 * to service-worker, and the manifest would just 404 inside the WebView.
