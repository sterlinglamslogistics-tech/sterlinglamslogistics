# driver-mobile-2 build script — produces an offline-first APK that
# runs entirely from local files. Pipeline:
#
#   1. Sync source files FROM the main project INTO source/
#      (components, lib, hooks, the driver app routes, globals.css).
#      Anything outside this script's allow-list is ignored, so we
#      don't accidentally pull in admin pages, API routes, or Sentry.
#
#   2. Adapt the copied driver routes for static export:
#      - The main project has them at app/(app)/driver/page.tsx etc.
#        Here we move them to app/page.tsx, app/dashboard/page.tsx, etc.
#      - Strip any server-only imports.
#
#   3. pnpm install + next build inside source/.
#      Output lands in source/out/.
#
#   4. Copy source/out/ over ../www/ (preserving the offline.html that
#      driver-mobile already ships).
#
#   5. npx cap sync android — registers the assets with the Capacitor
#      Android project.
#
#   6. (Optional) -Build flag also runs gradlew assembleRelease.
#
# Run from the driver-mobile-2/ folder:
#   .\build.ps1            # builds www/ only, leaves you ready to test
#                          # with Android Studio
#   .\build.ps1 -Build     # also assembles the release APK in
#                          # android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
